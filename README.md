# uni-course-planner

This is a program to help HKU students to check which CS elective course they can take based on their already taken course.

# How To Use

1. Insert the course codes that you have already taken inside the `csv-course-taken.xlsx`. Save it. 
2. Run `checker.py` at your local computer and you will see a `csv-course-i-can-take.csv` with the eligible courses inside it.
